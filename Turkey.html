      <h3>Turkey</h3>
      <p>Officially the Republic of Turkey, is a transcontinental country located mainly in Western Asia with a portion in Southeast Europe. Throughout its history, Turkey has acted as both a barrier and a bridge between the two continents. Turkey is situated at the crossroads of the Balkans, Caucasus, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. It is among the larger countries of the region in terms of territory and population, and its land area is greater than that of any European state.</p>

      <h3>Istanbul</h3>
      <p>Istanbul is a major city in Turkey that straddles Europe and Asia across the Bosphorus Strait. Its Old City reflects cultural influences of the many empires that once ruled there. Within the Sultanahmet district, the open-air Roman-era Hippodrome was the site of chariot races for many centuries, and many Egyptian obelisks also remain. The iconic and well-known Byzantine Hagia Sophia features a soaring 6th-century dome and rare Christian mosaics.</p>

      <h3>Cappadocia</h3>
      <p>Cappadocia, a semi-arid region in centural Turkey, is known for its distinctive "fairy chimneys," tall, cone-shaped rock formations clustered in Monks Valley, Göreme and elsewhere. Other notable sites include Bronze Age homes carved into valley walls by troglodytes, also known as cave dwellers, and later used as refuges by early Christians. Also, the 100m-deep Ihlara Canyon houses numerous rock-face churches.</p>
